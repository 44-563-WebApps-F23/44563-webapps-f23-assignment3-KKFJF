    <h1>Deepthi</h1>
    <p>Hi there! I once climbed Mount Everest just for fun!</p>
    <h2>Favorite Food  is biryani</h2>
    <p>I absolutely adore biryani for its exquisite blend of aromatic spices, tender pieces of meat, or flavorful vegetables, all layered with fragrant, long-grain Basmati rice. 
        The burst of flavors with every bite, the richness of saffron and ghee, and the perfect balance of heat and depth in the spices make biryani an absolute delight for my taste buds.
         The way each ingredient comes together to create a symphony of flavors is nothing short of culinary magic.</p>
